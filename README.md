# SecureBox API 🔐

A self-hosted secrets storage API written in Go, designed as a personal learning project to build skills in:

- 🟡 Go (Golang) development
- 🟣 Docker containerization
- ⚫ Linux CLI usage and scripting
- ☸️ Kubernetes orchestration
- 🧠 Cloud-native application design

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

This project is being built from scratch to:
- Learn modern backend development with Go
- Master Docker and container workflows
- Understand and implement Kubernetes deployments
- Refresh programming concepts after a break
- Build a professional-quality open-source project for a backend/cloud role

---

## 🔧 Core Features (Planned)

- `POST /secrets`: Store encrypted secrets
- `GET /secrets/:id`: Retrieve stored secrets
- `DELETE /secrets/:id`: Delete stored secrets
- Secrets encrypted using AES (or bcrypt)
- Dockerized API for easy deployment
- Ready for deployment in a Kubernetes cluster

## 🧑‍💻 Learning Log

This project is built as a self-teaching tool. I’ll update this section with insights, challenges, and what I’ve learned at each stage.

### Stage 1 
Refreshed my knowledge on GIT, how to set up VS Code for GoLang and in general refreshing my knowledge on project setup.

---

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **Go 1.21+**
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes (minikube)** for deployment
